
I am a fourth-year PhD candidate specializing in computer and information sciences at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. I am engaged in research that revolves around quantitative technology forecasting, utilizing methodologies from both statistics and machine learning.

I have served as a teaching assistant and instructor for undergraduate courses such as Web Client Applications and System Analysis and Design, as well as for the graduate-level course Information Systems Analysis.

Before pursuing my doctoral studies, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering and master's degrees in Business Administration, Economics and Finance, and Information Science. My career journey began in engineering, focusing on quality control and process improvement, and transitioned into roles dedicated to supply chain planning and optimization.
